| **Assets by Status**                     | Bar/Pie chart showing how many assets are in each status: *Available, Assigned, Under Maintenance*. Useful to monitor overall stock. |
| **Assets Allocated Over Time**           | Line graph of how many assets were assigned each month. Great for visualizing usage trends.                                          |
| **Employee Distribution by Designation** | Pie chart showing number of employees grouped by designation (Manager, Employee, Intern). Helps HR & resource planning.              |
| **Aging Assets**                         | List of assets older than a certain age (e.g., 3 years). Useful for identifying assets due for replacement or warranty expiration.   |
| **Issue Trend Over Time**                | Line/bar chart showing number of issues reported month-by-month. Reveals spikes in technical problems or maintenance needs.          |
| **Frequent Asset Categories**            | Analyze which asset categories are used the most (e.g., laptops, monitors). Good for purchase planning.                              |
| **Monthly Asset Purchase Volume**        | Track how many assets were bought in each month. Helps budget forecasting.                                                           |
| **Asset Utilization Efficiency**         | Percentage of total assets that are currently allocated. Indicates whether assets are underutilized.                                 |
| **Department-wise Allocation Breakdown** | If department data is added, you can break down assets assigned per department.                                                      |

| **Upcoming Warranty Expirations**        | Timeline or list of assets whose warranty is about to expire. Useful for proactive action.                                           |
