# Soft Deletion Implementation Guide

## Overview
Soft deletion has been implemented for the Employee module to maintain data integrity and preserve historical records while preventing foreign key constraint violations.

## Database Changes

### 1. Employee Table Schema Updates
```sql
-- New columns added:
ALTER TABLE `employee` ADD COLUMN `is_deleted` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER `is_admin`;
ALTER TABLE `employee` ADD COLUMN `deleted_at` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER `is_deleted`;
CREATE INDEX `idx_is_deleted` ON `employee` (`is_deleted`);
```

### 2. Run Migration Script
Execute the following SQL files in order:
1. `sql/add_soft_deletion.sql` - For existing databases
2. `sql/create_tables.sql` - For new installations (already includes soft deletion)

## Code Changes Made

### 1. EmployeeModel.php
- **deleteEmployee()**: Changed from `DELETE` to `UPDATE` with `is_deleted = 1`
- **getEmployeeCount()**: Added `WHERE is_deleted = 0`
- **getEmployeeById()**: Added `WHERE is_deleted = 0`
- **getPaginatedEmployeeList()**: Added `WHERE is_deleted = 0`
- **restoreEmployee()**: New method to restore soft-deleted employees

### 2. EmployeeValidator.php
- **isUsernameTaken()**: Added `AND is_deleted = 0`
- **isEmailTaken()**: Added `AND is_deleted = 0`
- **isPhoneTaken()**: Added `AND is_deleted = 0`

### 3. ValidationHelper.php
- **isUnique()**: Added soft deletion check for employee table

### 4. AuthenticationModel.php
- **getUser()**: Added `AND is_deleted = 0`
- **getUserBySessionCookie()**: Added `AND is_deleted = 0`

### 5. API Search (api/employee/search.php)
- Added `AND is_deleted = 0` to search queries

### 6. AssetModel.php
- **getPaginatedAssetList()**: Updated to show "(Deleted)" for soft-deleted employees

### 7. AssetLedgerModel.php
- **getPaginatedLedgerList()**: Updated to show "(Deleted)" for soft-deleted employees

### 8. deleteEmployeeController.php
- Removed asset assignment checks (no longer needed with soft deletion)
- Simplified deletion logic

## Benefits of Soft Deletion

### 1. Data Integrity
- ✅ Preserves foreign key relationships
- ✅ Maintains historical asset assignment records
- ✅ No orphaned records in asset_ledger table

### 2. Audit Trail
- ✅ Complete history of employee actions
- ✅ Compliance with data retention policies
- ✅ Ability to track who assigned assets (even deleted employees)

### 3. Recovery Options
- ✅ Accidental deletion recovery with `restoreEmployee()` method
- ✅ Data can be restored without losing relationships
- ✅ Admin can undelete employees if needed

### 4. Performance
- ✅ No foreign key constraint checks during deletion
- ✅ Faster deletion operations
- ✅ Indexed `is_deleted` column for efficient filtering

## Usage Examples

### Soft Delete an Employee
```php
$result = EmployeeModel::deleteEmployee($conn, $emp_id);
// Employee is marked as deleted but data remains
```

### Restore a Deleted Employee
```php
$result = EmployeeModel::restoreEmployee($conn, $emp_id);
// Employee is restored and can login again
```

### Get Only Active Employees
```php
$employees = EmployeeModel::getPaginatedEmployeeList($conn, $limit, $offset);
// Returns only non-deleted employees
```

## User Interface Updates

### Employee List View
- Shows only active (non-deleted) employees
- Deleted employees don't appear in normal lists

### Asset Views
- Shows "(Deleted)" next to names of soft-deleted employees
- Historical assignments remain visible with context

### Reports
- Asset assignments to deleted employees are preserved
- Full audit trail maintained

## Admin Features (Future Enhancement)

### Potential Admin Panel Features:
1. **View Deleted Employees**: Show list of soft-deleted employees
2. **Restore Employee**: Ability to undelete employees
3. **Permanent Deletion**: Hard delete after retention period
4. **Deletion Reports**: Track who deleted what and when

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
- Soft-deleted employees cannot login
- Session cookies are invalidated for deleted users
- API searches exclude deleted employees

### 2. Data Privacy
- Deleted employee data remains in database
- Consider GDPR compliance for permanent deletion
- Implement data retention policies

## Testing Checklist

### Database Operations
- [ ] Soft delete employee (UPDATE operation)
- [ ] Verify employee list excludes deleted
- [ ] Verify asset assignments remain intact
- [ ] Test restore functionality

### Authentication
- [ ] Deleted employee cannot login
- [ ] Session validation excludes deleted users
- [ ] Password reset unavailable for deleted users

### Asset Management
- [ ] Asset assignments show "(Deleted)" for deleted employees
- [ ] Historical data preserved in asset ledger
- [ ] No orphaned records created

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Employee search excludes deleted employees
- [ ] Validation checks work correctly
- [ ] No duplicate conflicts with deleted employees

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Database:
1. Backup current database
2. Run `sql/add_soft_deletion.sql`
3. Update application code (already done)
4. Test employee deletion functionality

### For New Installation:
1. Run `sql/create_tables.sql` (includes soft deletion)
2. Deploy application code
3. Test complete functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback steps:
1. Restore database backup
2. Revert code changes to hard deletion
3. Handle foreign key constraints manually

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Manage deleted employees
2. **Automated Cleanup**: Permanently delete after X days
3. **Audit Logging**: Track deletion/restoration actions
4. **Bulk Operations**: Delete/restore multiple employees
5. **Export Deleted Data**: For compliance reporting

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Single UPDATE vs DELETE
- **Improved query performance**: With proper indexing
- **Reduced foreign key constraint checks**
- **Faster deletion operations**

This implementation follows industry best practices and provides a robust solution for employee data management while maintaining referential integrity.
