# Employee Module Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. JavaScript BASE_URL Issue ✅
**Problem**: `window.BASE_URL` was undefined, causing routing failures
**Fix**: Added BASE_URL definition in head.php layout component
```php
<script>
    window.BASE_URL = '<?= BASE_URL ?>';
</script>
```

### 2. JavaScript Conflicts ✅ 
**Problem**: modal.js was conflicting with employee-list.js delete button handling
**Fix**: Removed modal.js from employee controller, integrated modal handling into EmployeeListManager

### 3. Edit/Delete Button Styling ✅
**Problem**: Buttons weren't styled properly and missing hover effects
**Fix**: Enhanced CSS with proper styling, transitions, and hover effects

### 4. Table Column Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: "No records found" message spanned 6 columns but table has 7
**Fix**: Updated colspan to 7 to match table structure

### 5. JavaScript Event Binding ✅
**Problem**: Events might not be binding due to timing issues
**Fix**: Added comprehensive debug logging and improved event binding

### 6. Caching Issues ✅
**Problem**: Browser might cache old JavaScript/CSS files
**Fix**: Added timestamp version parameters to force cache refresh
